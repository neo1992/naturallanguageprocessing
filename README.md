# naturallanguageprocessing
This project contains concepts of Natural Language Processing using nltk. Twitter Sentiment Analysis is also done using nltk, sklearn and matplotlib and tweepy library used for live twitter feed streaming. 
Project is not well structured since I was using same project for both twiiter sentiment and learning natural language processing. I have uploaded the concepts just to show beginners understand the concpets.
